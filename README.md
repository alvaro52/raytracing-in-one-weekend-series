# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This project implements the concepts from the *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* 
series using Rust. It covers the core techniques of ray tracing, building a 
toy ray tracer from "scratch", along with adding more advanced features in 
subsequent parts of the series.

## In One Weekend
In the first part, the goal is to create a simple ray tracer capable of rendering spheres with reflections and basic shading. Here's the final scene rendered by the ray tracer after completing *Ray Tracing in One Weekend*:

## The Next Week
In The Next Week, the ray tracer is extended to handle more complex 
materials, lighting models and textures. Here are some 
sample renders showcasing these features:

### Added Moving Spheres and Some Textures

### Simple Light Source And Perlin Noise
A scene with a simple light source:

### Cornell Box
The classic Cornell Box scene, especially focusing on **color bleeding**â€”where the red and green walls softly influence the surrounding surfaces:

### Cornell Box with Smoke Blocks
A variation of the Cornell Box featuring constant mediums like smoke blocks

### Finished Implementing AABBs

Then tested with a mesh that has 870000 triangles, with 1000 samples per 
pixel took "only" 3 minutes:
